> Adobe XD is made for fast, fluid UX design with innovative tools that eliminate speed bumps and deliver breakthrough performance. Switch from design to prototype in a single click. Quickly create wireframes and visual designs, preview changes in real time, and share prototypes with your team for instant feedback

+ Streamlined design - Speed up your design process with intuitive tools that let you draw, reuse and remix elements to create wireframes, visual designs, interactive prototypes and production-ready assets all in the same app.

+ Interactive prototypes – Add interactions and animations to accurately test how users will experience your design. Switch easily between design and prototype without leaving the app. 

+ Live previews – Eliminate guesswork by previewing your designs complete with transitions. Make changes and see them immediately applied so your experience looks just the way you want it. 
+ Easy sharing – Send a link to team members and get quick feedback on your designs. Share production-ready artwork with developers so they can build to your specifications.
