+ Interactive prototypes – Add interactions and animations to accurately test how users will experience your design. Switch easily between design and prototype without leaving the app. 

+ Live previews – Eliminate guesswork by previewing your designs complete with transitions. Make changes and see them immediately applied so your experience looks just the way you want it.
